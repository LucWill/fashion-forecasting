# üßµ Fashion Forward Forecasting ‚Äì StyleSense Recommendation Predictor

## üìå Project Overview

**StyleSense** is a rapidly growing online retailer in women's fashion. As the customer base grows, the company faces a backlog of product reviews with missing information about whether a product was recommended. This project addresses that challenge by creating a **machine learning pipeline** to predict product recommendations based on review text, customer data, and product information.

The model analyzes:
- üìù Review text (`Title` and `Review Text`)
- üéÇ Customer age
- üßµ Product metadata (e.g., class, department)
- üìà Feedback metrics

The output is a prediction: **Will the customer recommend the product or not?**

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- `pandas`, `numpy` for data handling
- `scikit-learn` for preprocessing, modeling, and pipeline structure
- `spaCy` for NLP (lemmatization, POS/NER)
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualization
- (Optional) `Streamlit` or `Gradio` for interactive dashboard

## ‚öôÔ∏è Pipeline Overview

The ML pipeline handles **preprocessing, feature engineering, training, and inference** in one structure:

### Preprocessing Steps:
- Imputation of missing values (numeric & categorical)
- Scaling for numerical features
- One-hot encoding for categorical features
- TF-IDF vectorization for text fields
- Custom NLP features (e.g., lemmatization, POS/NER)

### Model:
- `RandomForestClassifier` (initial baseline)
- Tuned using `GridSearchCV` for better performance

### Evaluation:
- Train/test split
- Classification metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Visualization of results and feature importance

---

## üìä Results

- Achieved **X% accuracy** on the test set
- Insights:
  - Text features provided strong predictive power
  - Customers in certain product categories were more likely to recommend items
  - Feedback counts and review length also showed signal

*(Update with actual performance numbers and insights.)*

## üß† Future Improvements

- Incorporate word embeddings or transformer-based NLP (e.g., `spaCy` vectors, BERT)
- Explore sentiment analysis
- Build an interactive prediction dashboard
- Deploy pipeline with a front-end using Streamlit or Gradio
